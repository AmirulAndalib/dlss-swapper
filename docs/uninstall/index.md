## Additional instructions if you installed via GitHub
When you originally installed DLSS Swapper from GitHub you also need to install a developer certificate. If you are migrating to the [Microsoft Store version](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NNL4H1PTJBL) or are just cleaning this app out you should remove this. If you have only ever installed via the Microsoft Store this does not apply to you.

1. Open `Manage user certificates`

2. Expand `Trusted People` and select `Certificates` to see `dlss-swapper`

If you don't see `Certificates` option or `dlss-swapper` then it is possible you either:
- Installed certificate into a different certificate store when you followed the (https://beeradmoore.github.io/dlss-swapper/install/)[install instructions]
- Possibly have already removed the certificate. You can use `Action` -> `Find Certificates...` and enter `dlss-swapper` into the `Contains` field to try search for it.

3. Right mouse click the `dlss-swapper` certificate and select `Delete`. 

4. Select `Yes` when prompted to permanently delete.
