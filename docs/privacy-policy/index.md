## Privacy Policy

##### The short but sweet privacy policy.

DLSS Swapper does not collect any information on users, their system, their games or their DLSS versions from the DLSS Swapper application.

Windows Store collects information such as install date, daily active users, etc. None of this information (as far as I am aware) is personally identifiable information. Opting out of Windows Store metrics is out of scope of this project, but if you wish to do so you should contact Microsoft Support.
